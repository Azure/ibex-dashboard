2. Clone & Deploy:
3. [Create a new Web App in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-continuous-deployment)

Since application insights API doesn't support ARM yet, we need to manually [create an API Key](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID) for the application insights service.
Once you created the api key, copy and paste it into the **Dashboard settings screen**.

## Create new API Key and Application ID

The following steps explain how to connect **Application Insights** bot with your bot and your dashboard:
[you can also follow the [official Application Insights article](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID)].

1. Go to [azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select: **Resource Groups** > **[new resource group]** > **App Insights Service**
3. Copy **Instrumentation Key** and paste into your bot registration page (on the bottom)
4. Click: **API Access** > **Create New Key** > **+ Read Telemetry**
5. Copy `Application ID` + `API Key`
6. Open the URL of your web app
7. Under **AppId**/**ApiKey** set the values you created.
