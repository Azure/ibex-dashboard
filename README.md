# Ibex Dashboard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CatalystCode/ibex-dashboard.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CatalystCode/ibex-dashboard)

Ibex is a dashboarding application that enables building dashboard and templates.
It mainly supports **Application Insights** but data sources and visual components are easily extendable.

2. `docker run -d -e PORT=80 **image name** `
3. Docker image is also available at Docker Hub - `docker pull catalystcode/ibex-dashboard`

## Application Insights Integration

Since application insights API doesn't support ARM yet, we need to manually [create an API Key](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID) for the application insights service.
The full instructions are also available when you create a new dashboard.

You can also follow the next headline.

## Create new API Key and Application ID

The following steps explain how to connect **Application Insights** bot with your bot and your dashboard:
[you can also follow the [official Application Insights article](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID)].

1. Go to [azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select: **Resource Groups** > **[new resource group]** > **App Insights Service**
3. Copy **Instrumentation Key** and paste into your bot registration page (on the bottom)
4. Click: **API Access** > **Create New Key** > **+ Read Telemetry**
5. Copy `Application ID` + `API Key`
6. Open the URL of your web app
7. Under **AppId**/**ApiKey** set the values you created.

### Technologies In Use

* https://facebook.github.io/react/
* https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
* http://recharts.org/
* https://react-md.mlaursen.com/

### Design and Patterns
This project is built using:

* https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

The server approach was added using:

* https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/

Thinking about integrating with:

* https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md


### Engines

* Running node version 6.11 or above. 

### Test Watcher
The test watcher is integrated into the create-react-app mechanism and runs tests related to files changes since the last commit.

To run the test watcher in an interactive mode:

```bash
cd client
yarn test
```

Alternatively, you can also run the full commands that the Travis CI server
will run to validate any changes.

```bash
.travis/ci.sh
```

### Build for Production
Our CI server Travis creates new production builds automatically for changes
to master. If you need to create a build locally, you can execute the same
commands as the CI server.

```bash
yarn build
```

Or

```bash
.travis/build.sh
```
